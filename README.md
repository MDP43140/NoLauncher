# NoLauncher (Forked from https://github.com/Saranomy/NoLauncher)
mdp43140's Fork changes:
+ Going for as lightweight as possible.
+ Build script only available for Linux users (well you can add the gradlew.bat from the original repo).
+ Made themes as native to AOSP as possible (depends on the device).

A redacted version of a fast and simple Android launcher for low memory devices.
